# SMS_spam_detection

In today’s society, practically everyone has a mobile phone, and they all get communications (SMS/ email) on their phone regularly. But the essential point is that majority of the messages received will be spam, with only a few being ham or necessary communications.

we’ll build a TensorFlow-based Spam detector; in simpler terms, we will have to classify the texts as Spam or Ham. This implies that Spam detection is a case of a Text Classification problem

Python libraries make it very easy for us to handle the data and perform typical and complex tasks:-
Pandas – This library helps to load the data frame in a 2D array format and has multiple functions to perform analysis tasks in one go.
Numpy – Numpy arrays are very fast and can perform large computations in a very short time.
Matplotlib/Seaborn/Wordcloud– This library is used to draw visualizations.
NLTK – Natural Language Tool Kit provides various functions to process the raw textual data.
